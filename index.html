    <h1>About me</h1>

    image

    <p>
        I graduated Colorado State University with a bachelors in Communication Studies. I have worked a plethora of jobs since. In the stupply chain department I ran a liquor store, worked in a warehouse, a greenhouse, organized a trucking yard, and made malt for Coors Brewery. In the customer service sector I caddied, worked fast food, and held the service specialist title in an office setting. My transition to tech has led me to study html and css through Skillcrush, then a prep course at Galvamize before ending up in the University of Denvers bootcamp.
